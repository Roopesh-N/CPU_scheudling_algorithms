The main objective of this project is to implement the CPU scheduling algorithms such as FCFS, Round Robin, SPN, SRT, HRRN, Multi-level feedback. All these mentioned algorithms use similar semantics with different logics. Moreover, I have implemented this project using Android Java in Android studio. 

This application allows the user to enter dynamic values for each set of process and to select scheduling algorithm on dropdown to return the wait times, turn around times of each process.
